The PubMed abstracts and PMC full documents have been separated and are distributed in different files.\r\n\r\nThe baseline files are downloadable from the IDA service:\r\nTODO: add links\r\n\r\nWeekly incremental updates are available at <http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/pubmed_parses/>\r\n\r\n### Data format\r\n\r\nThe data set is released in the same XML format used by the Turku Event Extraction System (<http://jbjorne.github.io/TEES/>) and the XML format is described in TEES documentation <https://github.com/jbjorne/TEES/wiki/Interaction-XML> . Each <document> element has an _origId_ attribute which is the actual PubMed or PMC identifier.\r\n\r\nThe named entities are not stored as <entity> elements as shown in the TEES documentation but as <evex_entity> instead. Each of these elements has an attribute _entity_type_ which depicts the entity class. **This should not be confused** with the attribute _type_ which is necessary for the internal functionality of TEES.\r\n\r\nTODO: XML format information\r\nTODO: contact information\r\nTODO: citation information\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\n",
