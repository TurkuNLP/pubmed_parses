  "body": "### Syntactic parses and named entity recognition for PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central full documents\r\n\r\nThis is a documentation page for a release of syntactic parses and NER for PubMed and PubMed Central Open Access documents.\r\nAvailable analyses:\r\n\r\n- Sentence splitting\r\n- Tokenization\r\n- Part-of-speech tagging\r\n- Syntactic parsing (constituent and dependency)\r\n- Named entity recognition for genes and gene products (proteins), chemicals, organisms, cell lines and diseases.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nThe data set consists of a couple of larger baseline files and periodically added incremental updates. The PubMed abstracts and PMC full documents have been separated and are distributed in different files.\r\n\r\nThe baseline files are downloadable from the IDA service:\r\nTODO: add links\r\n\r\nWeekly incremental updates are available at <http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/pubmed_parses/>\r\n\r\n### Data format\r\n\r\nThe data set is released in the same XML format used by the Turku Event Extraction System (<http://jbjorne.github.io/TEES/>) and the XML format is described in TEES documentation <https://github.com/jbjorne/TEES/wiki/Interaction-XML> . Each <document> element has an _origId_ attribute which is the actual PubMed or PMC identifier.\r\n\r\nThe named entities are not stored as <entity> elements as shown in the TEES documentation but as <evex_entity> instead. Each of these elements has an attribute _entity_type_ which depicts the entity class. This should not be confused with the attribute _type_ which is necessary for the internal functionality of TEES.\r\n\r\nTODO: XML format information\r\nTODO: contact information\r\nTODO: citation information\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact Kai Hakala or Suwisa Kaewphan (first.last@utu.fi) if you have any issues, feedback or requests.\r\nIf you use the data, we would appreciate if you cite our paper: _Syntactic analyses and named entity recognition for PubMed and PubMed Central — up-to-the-minute_ (to appear)",
